    ## About HomeWorth Philly
    ---
    **HomeWorth Philly** is a machine learning–powered solution platform for predicting residential property prices in Philadelphia to generate fair price estimates based on key property characteristics.

    ## Core Business Problem

    Traditional approaches rely heavily on:
    - **Outdated transaction data** (limited to 2017–2018)
    - **Multiple Linear Regression**
        Struggles to capture non-linear relationships, especially with large and complex datasets
    - **Manual human intervention**, which introduces bias and inconsistency

    These factors lead to:
    - Mispriced properties  
    - Flawed housing policy decisions  
    - Inefficient tax assessments  

    ---

    ## Our Modern Approach

    We address this with a **modern ML-based mass appraisal system** using:
    - **Tree Based Regressor** — state-of-the-art, powerful models designed for both linear and non-linear data, and optimized for large datasets
    - Systematic **feature engineering and EDA**
    - **Model interpretability** via AI Powered

    ## Model Performance

    The model evaluated on previously unseen property data, it delivered **strong generalization**:
    - The model can explain over **94% of the variance** in market values. Solid predictive power.
    - The typical prediction error is **just under 10%**, making it reliable for real-world decisions.
    The model performs confidently across typical properties, with robust accuracy and manageable risk for mispricing.
    
         **Most impactful features**: (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
        `total livable area`, `total area`, `interior condition`, `location`

    Accurate residential valuation helps:
    - **Homeowners** price competitively  
    - **Buyers & lenders** make informed decisions  
    - **City governments** ensure fair taxation 
    - **Investors** spot opportunities  

    > Accurate mass prediction = better policy, fairer pricing, smarter investment.

    ## Analytic Framework

    - **EDA & Feature Engineering** on structured residential data
    - **Machine Learning Regression** (Random Forest) to predict market value
    - **Model evaluation**: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R²
    - **Error Analysis** between market value and predicted market value
